# Sprint 1 task 4 Level 2: AssertJ

This project demonstrates the use of AssertJ to perform various assertions in Java. Below are the exercises completed:

## Exercise 1
An assertion that demonstrates that the value of two integer objects is equal, and another that indicates that it is not.

## Exercise 2
An assertion that demonstrates that the reference to one object is the same as another, and another that indicates that it is different.

## Exercise 3
An assertion that indicates that two arrays of integers are identical.

## Exercise 4
Create an `ArrayList` containing various types of objects (create them as well). Write an assertion to verify the order of the objects in the `ArrayList` as they were inserted.

Now verify that the previous list contains the objects in any order.
Verify that, in the previous list, one of the objects has been added only once. Leave one of the elements out, and verify that the list does not contain the latter.

## Exercise 5
Create a `Map` and verify that it contains one of the keys that you added.

## Exercise 6
Cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in any class. Create an assertion that validates that the exception is thrown when appropriate.

## Exercise 7
Create an empty `Optional` object. Write the correct assertion to verify that it is indeed empty.
